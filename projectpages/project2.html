      <h1>Problem</h1>
      <p>Herbal teas have been a big trend for the last few years and we see new ones
      hitting the shelves all the time. My client needed to solidify and requested an
      e-commerce store design to shed light on the possibilities of promoting and growing his product and brand. Health Hooch is a homemade
      herbal tonic with major health benefits The goal was to provide a user-friendly, aesthetically appealing online store,
      and an easy shopping experience where consumers can shop for the product but also gain
      knowledge about the ingredients and benefits. The functional, clean design as well as strong brand development will be introduced to
      investors, and manufactures. My client also plans to apply the design to his designated e-commerce platform. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution">
      <h1>Solution</h1>
      <p>After going over details of the project and having in-depth conversation about the brand I was able to
      provide a user-friendly, bright and organized online store design. I also developed a brand that sends a message of strength
      and health. Health Hooch not only provides organic and safe products to consumers but they also learn
      while they're shopping. The store gives users an option to subscribe to a monthly plan or shop
      as guests giving them more purchasing power and freedom, which we believe will result in loyal subscribers.</p>

    <div class="branding">
      <p>Branding was very interesting! I had the chance to really dive into the history of Hooch.
      I could see where the product stood out compared to it's competitors. Hooch is originally a potent
      alcoholic beverage usually made in the woods because it is highly illegal. Names that most people are familiar
      with are: Moonshine, white lightning, mountain dew, choop, homebrew, shiney, or white whiskey. With that in
      mind, we knew that the route we wanted to take Health Hooch was a rugged, dark and natural theme. </p>

      <p class="logo-paragraph">I performed market research on 4 other logo
      designs from our competitors and incorporated things that my client
      liked from each. This was strictly experimental and assisted in solidifying  the path for Health Hooch.
      I worked down to 3 final sketches and placed them on packaging mockups for my client to review as well.
      The current logo name is enclosed inside large typeface of the same letter, simple but creative, this
      worked well for marketing and trending names like "HH". A ring was added, which represents
      the bottom of a mason jar, which hooch is closely associated with. To ensure our users understood
      that this is a healthy product I added custom vector leaves at the bottom of the ring. </p>

     The color palette was fairly easy to accomplish, although there was hesitation
     on different shades of each color selected. We wanted to ensure that we were capturing
     the boldness of Health Hooch through it's colors. Nature colors were selected on a  darker scale and
     I also aimed for modern fitness colors.


     I chose Oswald for it's origin in classic gothic and grotesque styles of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
     Oswald is available in light, normal and bold weights. I felt that this typeface fit perfectly with the bold brand created for Health Hooch.
     I decided to pair it with an easy to read and versatile typeface, Roboto , used only for body context. </p>

      <div class="learn">
    <p class="learned-paragraph"> This project introduced me to the e-commerce business and how
      important design and brand are when it comes to growing a business like this. I also learned
      that even in a saturated market there is still enough room for aspiring entreprenuers to introduce
      their products to consumer, as long as they have a unique twist to stand out. The client relationship
      was phenomenal and really opened my eyes to the needs of a client who has trusted me with delivering
      their message in a memorable way. The research that I performed, taught me alot about how users shop
      online vs in store and aided me in providing the best solution to enhance their online shopping experience.
