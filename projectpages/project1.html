      <h1>PROBLEM</h1>
      <p>Cloud storage users want a safe and reliable
      space to store their memories, work, music and more.
      There are many options out there, but users still
      face a number of frustrations. My research showed
      that users want better security measures, and a reliable
      system that won't fail them if their wifi goes down.
      Complicated organization, and saving links are among those
      frutrations and easy collaboration was also crucial to work teams.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
      <h1>SOLUTION</h1>
      <p>My research indicated a highly diverse
      audience that represented every kind of user. With
      extensive research the solution resulted in an app that
      inspired easy organization through folders and categories
      only. PUSH provides a secure offline version so users can
      work offline,and when it comes to our users feeling safe
      while sharing, they can depend on several layers of security.
      These features include expiration and a 6 digit custom code.</p>

      <div class="learn">
    <p class="learned-paragraph">Through my design process I found that overstimulating
    users is definitely possible. Distractions like the over stimulating aspects of <thead>
    product, </thead> resulted in a poor experience. I  became overly concerned
    with trends, and visuals that I did not have much experience using, only to crash and burn.
    After revisiting my surveys,analysis and performing more testing I came back to what the goal
    actually was, and what solution was needed. I revamped the entire product from some of the major
    wireframes to the icons, buttons and color palette. The users
    instantly felt the growth of the project and dove right in without hesitation,
    it was as if they used the product before. It was clean, easy and aesthetically
    appealing. I constantly called, chatted and asked questions and requested explanations.
    My biggest accomplishment is when I realized how much value there is in
    allowing the users to co-create.
